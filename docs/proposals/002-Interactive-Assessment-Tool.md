## Branches and Pull requests

*To be added as development progresses*

## Abstract

The current assessment section of the DISCOVER Cookbook provides basic guidance on post-event surveys but lacks practical, actionable tools for event organizers to systematically measure and improve their diversity and inclusion efforts. This proposal introduces an **Interactive Digital Assessment Tool** - a comprehensive dashboard and analytics platform that transforms the static assessment guidance into a dynamic, data-driven system for measuring inclusion effectiveness.

The tool will provide pre-built survey templates, real-time data visualization, automated reporting, benchmarking capabilities, and anonymous feedback systems to help conference organizers make evidence-based decisions about their inclusion strategies.

## Detailed description

### Current Problem

The existing [Assessment section](../../DISCOVER/12_assessment.md) offers only high-level guidance:
- Basic suggestion to "survey participants after the event" 
- Vague advice about correlating minority status with welcoming feelings
- No specific survey questions, templates, or measurement frameworks
- No tools for data analysis or visualization
- No benchmarking against industry standards or other events
- No way to track improvement over time

This creates several challenges for event organizers:

1. **Implementation Barrier**: Organizers must create surveys from scratch without guidance on effective questions
2. **Data Analysis Gap**: Raw survey data requires significant expertise to analyze meaningfully
3. **No Benchmarking**: Organizers can't compare their results to industry standards or peer events
4. **Limited Actionability**: Without clear metrics and trends, it's difficult to prioritize improvements
5. **Inconsistent Measurement**: Different events use different assessment methods, making community learning difficult

### Proposed Solution

An integrated web-based assessment platform that includes:

#### 1. **Pre-built Survey Templates**
- Evidence-based question sets targeting different inclusion aspects:
  - General inclusion climate
  - Accessibility satisfaction
  - Safety and code of conduct effectiveness  
  - Demographic representation satisfaction
  - Barrier identification surveys
- Customizable templates for different event types (conferences, workshops, meetups)
- Multi-language support for international events
- Integration with popular survey platforms (Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Typeform)

#### 2. **Real-time Data Visualization Dashboard**
- Live updating charts as responses come in
- Demographic breakdowns and cross-tabulations
- Heat maps for identifying problematic areas
- Sentiment analysis of open-ended responses
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go monitoring

#### 3. **Automated Analytics & Reporting**
- Statistical significance testing for demographic differences
- Trend analysis comparing year-over-year improvements
- Automated identification of concerning patterns
- Executive summary generation with key insights
- Customizable report templates for stakeholders

#### 4. **Benchmarking System**
- Anonymous data sharing with community benchmarks
- Industry-specific comparison groups (tech, academic, non-profit)
- Event size and type normalization
- Best practice identification from high-performing events
- Goal-setting based on realistic benchmarks

#### 5. **Anonymous Feedback Integration**
- Real-time incident reporting during events
- Anonymous suggestion boxes
- Safe space reporting mechanisms
- Integration with existing code of conduct enforcement

### Use Cases

**Pre-Event Planning**: Organizers select appropriate survey templates and set up data collection infrastructure

**During Event**: Real-time monitoring of anonymous feedback and incident reports help organizers respond quickly

**Post-Event Analysis**: Automated reports highlight successes and areas for improvement, with specific recommendations

**Long-term Planning**: Trend analysis and benchmarking inform strategic planning for future events

**Community Learning**: Anonymized data contributes to community-wide best practices and standards

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Survey Infrastructure (Months 1-3)
- **Survey Template Library**: Create 5-10 evidence-based survey templates covering key inclusion dimensions
- **Basic Dashboard**: Develop responsive web interface with fundamental data visualization
- **Data Collection API**: Build secure, GDPR-compliant data collection and storage system
- **Pilot Testing**: Deploy with 3-5 volunteer events for initial feedback

*Dependencies*: Jupyter Book integration, secure hosting infrastructure
*Deliverables*: Working MVP with core survey functionality

### Phase 2: Analytics & Visualization (Months 4-6)
- **Advanced Analytics Engine**: Implement statistical analysis, demographic comparisons, significance testing
- **Visualization Library**: Develop comprehensive charting and reporting capabilities
- **Export Features**: Enable PDF report generation and data export functionality
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure full mobile responsiveness and offline capabilities

*Dependencies*: Phase 1 completion, user feedback integration
*Deliverables*: Full-featured analytics platform

### Phase 3: Benchmarking & Community Features (Months 7-9)
- **Benchmarking System**: Develop anonymous data sharing and comparison infrastructure
- **Community Dashboard**: Create aggregate insights and best practice sharing
- **Advanced Reporting**: Implement automated insights and recommendation engine
- **Integration Tools**: Build connectors for popular survey platforms

*Dependencies*: Critical mass of user data, community engagement
*Deliverables*: Complete benchmarking and community platform

### Phase 4: AI/ML Enhancement (Months 10-12)
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Implement ML-driven suggestions for improvement areas
- **Predictive Analytics**: Develop models for forecasting inclusion outcomes
- **Natural Language Processing**: Automated analysis of open-ended feedback
- **Personalization**: Customized dashboards based on event type and historical data

*Dependencies*: Sufficient data for ML training, advanced technical expertise
*Deliverables*: AI-enhanced assessment platform

### Technical Considerations

**Frontend**: React/Vue.js web application with responsive design
**Backend**: Python/Django or Node.js API server
**Database**: PostgreSQL with proper data anonymization
**Analytics**: Integration with pandas, plotly, and statistical libraries  
**Hosting**: Cloud-based solution (AWS/GCP) with scalability
**Security**: GDPR compliance, data encryption, secure authentication

### Integration with DISCOVER Cookbook

- **Embedded Widgets**: Interactive assessment tools embedded directly in relevant cookbook sections
- **Contextual Guidance**: Assessment tools linked to specific cookbook recommendations
- **Live Examples**: Real dashboard examples demonstrating concepts from the cookbook
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Static content enhanced with interactive features where available

## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Static Template Library
**Approach**: Provide downloadable survey templates and analysis guides without interactive platform
**Pros**: Lower development cost, easier maintenance
**Cons**: Maintains current implementation barriers, no benchmarking or community learning

### Alternative 2: Third-party Integration
**Approach**: Partner with existing survey platforms to provide DISCOVER-specific templates
**Pros**: Leverages existing infrastructure, faster implementation
**Cons**: Limited customization, data silos, dependency on external platforms

### Alternative 3: Community Wiki/Forum
**Approach**: Create community-driven sharing of assessment experiences and templates
**Pros**: Leverages community expertise, organic growth
**Cons**: Inconsistent quality, no standardization, limited analytical capabilities

### Why the Proposed Solution is Superior

The proposed Interactive Digital Assessment Tool provides:

1. **Lower Barrier to Entry**: Pre-built templates eliminate the expertise gap
2. **Actionable Insights**: Automated analysis transforms data into concrete recommendations  
3. **Community Learning**: Benchmarking enables collective improvement across the ecosystem
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Long-term tracking enables evidence-based iteration
5. **Integration**: Seamless connection with existing DISCOVER Cookbook content
6. **Scalability**: Platform approach serves growing community needs

This comprehensive approach addresses the core problem while building community capacity for long-term improvement in conference inclusion practices.

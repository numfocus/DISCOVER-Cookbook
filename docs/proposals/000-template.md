# Proposal Template

This proposal template is a guideline of the sections that a proposal should contain.  Extra sections may be added if appropriate, and unnecessary sections may be noted as such.

## Status

Proposals go through a number of phases in their lifetime:

- **Discussion**: The proposal is being actively discussed on the discussion board and it is being improved by its author.  The discussion of the proposal should include the proposal number (proposal-xxx) in the subject line so they can be easily related to the proposal.

- **Progress**: Consensus was reached and implementation work has begun.

- **Completed**: The implementation has been merged into main.

- **Superseded**: This proposal has been abandoned in favor of another approach.

- **Rejected**: There are currently no plans to implement the proposal.


## Branches and Pull requests

All development branches containing work on this proposal should be linked to from here.

All pull requests submitted relating to this proposal should be linked tofrom here.  (A proposal does not need to be implemented in a single pull request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete phases).


## Abstract

The abstract should be a short description of what the proposal will achieve.


## Detailed description

This section describes the need for the proposal.  It should describe the existing problem that it is trying to solve and why this proposal makes the situation better.  It should include examples of how the new functionality would be used and perhaps some use cases.


## Implementation

This section lists the major steps required to implement the proposal. Where possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on another, and which steps may be optionally omitted.  Where it makes sense, each step should include a link related pull requests as the implementation progresses.


## Alternatives

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem, they should be discussed here, along with a justification for the chosen approach.

### Translation related roles within the team

To ensure smooth collaboration and high-quality translations, our Transifex team is organized into three key roles. Each plays a vital part in the localization workflow:

#### Translator

Translators adapt content from the source language into their target language, helping us reach global audiences.

**Responsibilities:**

- Translate and submit content  
- Join team discussions to ask questions or share insights  

Whether you're new to localization or a seasoned polyglot, this role is a great starting point for contributing meaningfully.

---

#### Reviewer

Reviewers are the quality gatekeepers. They ensure translations are accurate, culturally appropriate, and aligned with our standards.

**Responsibilities:**

- Review and proofread translations  
- Submit approved translations  
- Participate in team discussions  

If you're confident in your translation skills and detail-oriented, this role is a great way to elevate the project’s quality.

---

#### Language Coordinator

Language Coordinators oversee translation efforts for a specific language. They act as language-level team leads, guiding contributors and ensuring consistency.

**Responsibilities:**

- Invite new members to their language team  
- Approve or deny join requests  
- Assign or change contributor roles  
- Start and moderate team discussions  
- Review and proofread translations  
- Submit finalized translations  

If you're a seasoned contributor and passionate about your language, this role lets you help steward quality and collaboration.

> Please note, most contributors begin as Translators. As you gain experience and contribute consistently, you may be invited to take on Reviewer or Language Coordinator responsibilities. This gradual progression ensures everyone feels confident and supported in their role.

# Assessment of the event

 âœ… Survey participants after the event to establish whether your diversity and inclusion measures had an effect.

See whether there is any correlation between being part of a minority group and how welcoming the conference felt to the individual participants. You can consider specifically asking about inclusion/diversity on the survey.

## Practical considerations
- Have a plan in place to analyze the data shortly after the event -- this can be time-consuming and you will need lots of helping hands to clean data
- Make sure you review the survey outcomes after the meeting with your organizing committee
- Communicate any findings to the next organizing committee if the conference/event is part of a series

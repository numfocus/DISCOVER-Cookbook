"This cookbook is intended as a resource for organizers of conferences and "

"not provide any specific advice about budgeting, scheduling, A/V "

"Some &quot;basic&quot; best practice is understood to be a prerequisite for "
"many of our recommendations. For example, live-captioning support for the "
"hearing-impaired is not possible without reliable internet and good A/V "
"setup. In general, we have avoided explicitly calling out these implied "
"dependencies in order to maintain focus and keep the cookbook to a more "
"manageable length."

"This cookbook also does not offer reasons or rationale for **why inclusion "

"their conference or event, hence the suggestions herein are focused on the "
"&quot;how&quot; rather than the &quot;why&quot;."

        e.g.,
        For the 'Accessibility Considerations' subsection under 'Venue Selection & On-Site Services', I propose adding a new point:

        ### Create Access Visual & Hearing Disabilities
        - ‚úÖ Select a venue that has a hearing loop, or audio induction loop (a special type of sound system for use by people with hearing aids) and make sure it is used.

      label: Rationale & Expected Impact
      description: Explain *why* this enhancement is valuable. How does it improve clarity, actionability, inclusivity, or impact for conference organizers or attendees? How does it align with the üçé (easy, high impact) or ‚úÖ (more effort, considerable impact) framework?
      placeholder: "e.g., Adding a guideline about hearing loops significantly enhances accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing attendees, making the conference more inclusive. This is a ‚úÖ measure as it requires specific venue selection or setup but has a considerable positive impact."

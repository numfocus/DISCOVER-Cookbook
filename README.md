## The NumFOCUS DISCOVER Cookbook (Diverse & Inclusive Spaces and Conferences: Overall Vision and Essential Resources)

Produced by the NumFOCUS Diversity &amp; Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC) Program with support from the Moore Foundation.

## Introduction

### About this Cookbook:

This cookbook is intended as a resource for **organizers of conferences and events** — with a particular focus on the tech sector in the United States — to **support and encourage diversity and inclusion** at those events.

It focuses specifically on plans, decisions, and actions organizers can take to produce and manage a more diverse and inclusive event.

_Funding to produce this cookbook was made possible by a generous grant from the_ **Moore Foundation** _._

### What this Cookbook is not:

This cookbook is **not** intended to provide **general instructions** on how to run a successful conference or event. We do not provide any specific advice about budgeting, scheduling, A/V capabilities, how to structure tracks, etc.

Some &quot;basic&quot; best practice is understood to be a prerequisite for many of our recommendations. For example, live-captioning support for the hearing-impaired is not possible without reliable internet and good A/V setup. In general, we have avoided explicitly calling out these implied dependencies in order to maintain focus and keep the cookbook to a more manageable length.

This cookbook also does not offer reasons or rationale for **why inclusion and diversity are important**. The cookbook presumes the organizing committee is already interested in improving diversity and inclusion at their conference or event, hence the suggestions herein are focused on the &quot;how&quot; rather than the &quot;why&quot;.

### How to use this cookbook:

You **do not have to implement every suggestion** in the cookbook in order to &quot;qualify&quot; as having a diverse and inclusive event!

The cookbook is intended to help you, as an event organizer, to understand the **overall landscape** of best practices for diversity and inclusion.

**We encourage you to do as much as you can manage**, on the understanding that implementing a few well-supported and fully realized suggestions is preferable to implementing many suggestions that are poorly-supported or incomplete.

To facilitate ease of use, we have highlighted suggestions that are relatively **easy to implement** and which have a **strong positive impact**. These are &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; and marked with a red apple emoji: 🍎.

We also encourage you to do **at least one thing** in the &quot;High Impact, High Effort&quot; quadrant. These are marked with a green checkmark: ✅.

## Special Considerations Depending on Geographic Context

- Most of the material contained herein is written from the U.S. perspective (e.g. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protections). 
- Something to be aware of: some U.S. states may have discriminatory laws in place which could affect whether or not you should choose to host an event or conference there. 
- We welcome input on considerations for events and conferences in other countries.
- Additional considerations made need to be made for very remote event locations with no public transit, e.g. for folks who are mobility impaired.

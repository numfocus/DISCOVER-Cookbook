✅ Offer financial support for childcare.
 - Build it into your budget. 
   - Link it to sponsorships, or university partners, or make part of the registration fee from all attendees go towards providing childcare support as service. 
    - Add an option to the registration, e.g.: &quot;Donate $20 to help with childcare costs.&quot;
    - Collect the data on the registration form. How many people would make use of childcare services or grants?
  - In general, the two major options are either to 1) award childcare grants (people decide how to spend it, e.g. on their home babysitter) or 2) provide on-site services.

## Grants 

   - Based on our research, grants to cover childcare costs seem to be more popular with attendees. (On-site childcare services can be costly for attendees because of additional travel costs for bringing children along.) 
      - You might survey your participants to determine their preference for grants vs. on-site childcare services.
      - Be sure to consider issues like whether grant recipients will need to submit an invoice or receipt from someone (the childcare provider) with a Tax ID.
    - For those who do bring kids to the event/conference:
       - Provide cost-free access to the conference center/venue for caregivers/babysitters
          - This allows caregivers to come to the conference for e.g. infant hand-offs (for nursing, for example) as opposed to parents losing additional time walking back to hotel rooms.
      
## On-Site Services
 
- There are companies that provide childcare at conferences. While NumFOCUS makes no specific endorsements, we did find these companies in our research who are providing event-based childcare:
    - [Corporate Kids Events](https://conferencechildcare.com/)
   - [American Child Care, Inc.](http://www.americanchildcare.com/conventions.htm)
   - [Kiddie Corp](http://www.kiddiecorp.com/)
    - [Urbansitter](https://www.urbansitter.com/)
    - [Care.com](https://www.care.com/)
    - [Accent](http://www.accentoca.com/)
- Another possibility is to organize a &quot;parallel&quot; conference for older children
  - E.g. [coding for kids as at PyCon UK](http://2017.pyconuk.org/education/)

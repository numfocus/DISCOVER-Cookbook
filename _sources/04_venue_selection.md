# Venue Selection &amp; On-Site Services

## Accessibility Considerations
- Consider attendees who may need accommodations for a disability

### Mobility

- 🍎 Reserve seats in rooms for folks who might need it (wheelchair, crutches, cane, etc.). Choose easily accessible seats, such as at the end of a row on the aisle. 
- 🍎 Create wide aisles (2.5 m, so two power chairs can pass each other) between chairs to make it easier for people who are mobility-impaired to navigate the room.
- Reduce conference sprawl to support access for people who are mobility-impaired.
- Consider marking and enforcing "No Standing Zones" through rooms such as foyers that are both gathering areas and regions people must pass through. (A 2.5 m "corridor" marked on the ground in yellow tape is ideal.)
- Consider making remote access available via livestream, recorded talks, etc.
- Make sure the building is wheelchair accessible. (In the U.S. this is typically required by law.)
- Be aware of how far/near the closest wheelchair-accessible restrooms are. Attempt to shorten this distance when possible, and be sure all staff know where to direct attendees who require a wheelchair-accessible restroom. 

### Create Access Visual & Hearing Disabilities

- ✅ Book sign-language interpreters and/or real-time captioning (someone typing captions) for deaf and hard-of-hearing attendees. 
  - If the budget does not allow for both sign-language interpreters and captioning, we suggest that you opt for captioning, as it tends to create more access for a higher number of people. (See "Further Reading" below.)
- Select a venue that has a hearing loop, or audio induction loop (a special type of sound system for use by people with hearing aids) and make sure it is used

#### Signage
- Consider using patterns rather than just color on signs and presentation slides to indicate differences, to make comprehension easier for attendees with color blindness/low vision issues.
- Provide large-text signs and easy-to-read maps.
- Send maps to attendees in advance, with the event schedule. 
- Provide large-print copies of printed materials, such as program booklets, via printing normally A5 documents on A4, or folded A4-booklets on A3.

#### Microphones
- 🍎 Ask conference organizers to announce important information over the microphone, which helps people with impaired vision.
- Make sure that hand-held microphones are available 
- Encourage session chairs to repeat questions from the audience over the mic so everyone can hear
- Session chairs should ensure that the microphone is used (even if the speaker thinks their voice is loud enough)

## Bathrooms

### Gender-Neutral Bathrooms

- Ideally you would provide 3 types of restrooms: gender-neutral, female, male.
- ✅ Ensuring your conference has easily accessible gender-neutral restrooms is a simple way to help non-binary and trans individuals feel included and welcome at your conference.
- How to re-label bathrooms:
  - 🍎 List the specific amenities and what type of restroom it is. For example:
  - "All Gender Restroom: Facilities available in this restroom include individual stall toilets, an accessible stall toilet, urinals, sinks, and a changing table" For detailed guidelines and examples of inclusive restroom signage, refer to [Best Practices for All-Gender Restroom Signage](https://pridefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/All-Gender-Restrooms.pdf).
  - Post signs in the restroom and/or on the door instructing what to do if you think someone is in the "wrong" restroom 
    - For example: "If you think someone's gender doesn't match the sign on the door, please follow these steps: Don't worry about it, they know better than you." (via [@LGBTplusBristol](https://twitter.com/lgbtplusbristol))

### Toiletries/Supplies

- 🍎 Provide tampons and pads in **all** restrooms (some people who identify as male have periods and may need them)
- Consider using fragrance-free hand wash and reducing the use of air fresheners to help those with chemical sensitivities.

## 🍎 Dedicated rooms

- The rooms should be clearly labeled to prevent accidental entry, and their locations should be provided in both the print and the online conference directory and maps.
- Don't allow anyone (even organizers) to use the room for other purposes.

### 🍎 Nursing &amp; Pumping Room

- Ensure there is a dedicated, single-occupancy space with a locking door.
- For the room to be optimally useful, these things are desired:
  - Locking door
  - Comfortable chair (ideally, with arms that do not have gaps between the armrest and the seat, and a set of firm cushions for positioning an infant)
  - A desk or table next to the chair (to set the pump, bottles, etc. on), no more than 4 feet from the nearest electrical outlet
  - Cleaning wipes, paper towels, and a garbage can for maintaining cleanliness
  - Masking tape and a marker for labeling milk bottles and pump parts
  - Proximity to a sink for handwashing and washing of pump parts
  - A refrigerator for storage of pumped milk (could be in the pumping room, or ideally accessible outside the room but nearby)
  - If possible, a dimmable light or a small lamp could be provided instead of bright overhead lighting

### 🍎 Gender-Neutral Bottle Feeding Room

  - Bottle-fed babies can be fed by caregivers of any gender and also benefit from a quiet, low-distraction, private space for feeding.
  - This should be a separate, additional room (**NOT the same as the nursing and pumping room**). It could accommodate multiple babies at a time and be equipped with:
    - Multiple comfortable chairs with broad armrests to facilitate bottle feeding positions
    - A bottle warmer
    - Paper towels, cleaning wipes and garbage can for cleanliness
    - Dim lighting and in a quiet area of the conference center/venue
    - Clearly labeled to prevent accidental entry, though a locking door is not necessary

### 🍎 Quiet Room (also Prayer Room)

- A dedicated room for people who need a break from the stimulation of being surrounded by people at the conference.
  - No phone calls, talking/socializing, etc.
  - Put notifications on silent/vibrate.
  - People whose religions require frequent prayer (such as Muslims) can make use of the quiet room.
- Ideal is to provide one well lit quiet room, and a second dimly lit room.
- Consider "quiet areas" if a separate room is not possible.

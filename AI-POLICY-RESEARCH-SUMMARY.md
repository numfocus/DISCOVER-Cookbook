# AI Contribution Policy Research Summary

## Research Overview

This document summarizes the research conducted on AI contribution policies across major open source projects to inform the DISCOVER-Cookbook's policy development.

## Projects Studied

### 1. Python Foundation
**Policy Approach:** Balanced allowance with transparency requirements
- **Acceptable Uses:** Assistance with writing, understanding code, supplementing knowledge
- **Unacceptable Uses:** Fully AI-generated issues/PRs, unproductive contributions
- **Key Principle:** Human judgment and critical thinking required

### 2. Matplotlib
**Policy Approach:** Restrictive on AI-generated contributions
- **Key Concern:** License compatibility and restrictions on generative AI usage
- **Focus:** Ensuring BSD-compatible licensing is maintained
- **Notable:** Has specific restrictions mentioned in their developer guide

### 3. Linux Foundation
**Policy Approach:** Permissive with safeguards
- **Key Requirements:**
  - Check AI tool terms don't conflict with open source licenses
  - Ensure permissions for any third-party content in AI output
  - Provide attribution for third-party materials
- **Emphasis:** Individual projects may develop specific guidance

### 4. Apache Software Foundation (ASF)
**Policy Approach:** Detailed framework with clear requirements
- **Key Points:**
  - AI-generated content allowed if contributor ensures no licensing conflicts
  - Must verify no third-party copyrighted materials or proper permissions
  - Recommended practice: disclose AI tool usage
  - Template: "Generated-by: [tool]" in commits

### 5. Scientific Python Ecosystem (SciPy Discussion)
**Policy Approach:** Active debate, no consensus yet
- **Concerns Raised:**
  - Copyright and licensing issues
  - Code quality and reliability
  - Ethical considerations around training data
- **Proposed Solutions:**
  - "Only submit code you understand" principle
  - Potential need for SPEC (Scientific Python Enhancement Proposal)

### 6. QEMU Project
**Policy Approach:** Complete prohibition
- **Reasoning:** AI-generated code cannot satisfy Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO)
- **Key Issues:**
  - Human authorship requirements
  - Uncertainty about copyright status
  - Legal guarantees impossible to provide

### 7. Gentoo Linux
**Policy Approach:** Explicit prohibition
- **Reasoning:**
  - Copyright concerns and emerging regulations
  - Quality concerns with AI-generated content
  - Ethical concerns about AI business practices
- **Scope:** Applies to all Gentoo contributions

## Key Themes and Considerations

### 1. Legal and Copyright Concerns
- **Common Issue:** Uncertainty about copyright status of AI-generated content
- **Training Data:** Most AI models trained on copyrighted material of unclear licensing
- **License Compatibility:** Ensuring AI tool terms don't conflict with project licenses
- **Attribution:** Need to properly attribute any third-party content in AI output

### 2. Quality Assurance
- **Human Oversight:** Universal requirement for human review and understanding
- **Verification:** Need to fact-check and validate AI-generated content
- **Project Standards:** Maintaining consistency with existing quality standards

### 3. Transparency and Disclosure
- **Best Practice:** Disclosing AI tool usage becoming standard
- **Implementation:** Various approaches from commit message tags to PR templates
- **Community Trust:** Transparency helps maintain community confidence

### 4. Ethical Considerations
- **Training Data Sources:** Concerns about unauthorized use of copyrighted material
- **Environmental Impact:** Energy consumption of AI systems
- **Labor Impact:** Effects on human contributors and employment

## Recommendations for DISCOVER-Cookbook

### Why Option A (Guided AI Assistance) is Recommended

1. **Project-Specific Considerations:**
   - **Content-Focused:** DISCOVER-Cookbook is primarily documentation, not code
   - **Educational Mission:** Focuses on best practices and guidance
   - **Quality Critical:** Content accuracy is essential for conference organizers
   - **Community Trust:** High-visibility project requires maintaining credibility

2. **Alignment with Research:**
   - **Balanced Approach:** Follows successful models from Python and ASF
   - **Quality Focus:** Emphasizes human oversight like most successful policies
   - **Transparency:** Includes disclosure requirements per best practices
   - **Flexibility:** Allows useful AI assistance while preventing misuse

3. **Practical Benefits:**
   - **Grammar/Style:** AI can help with language improvements
   - **Translation:** Supports internationalization efforts
   - **Research:** Can assist with gathering information (with verification)
   - **Accessibility:** Can help improve content accessibility

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Adopt Option A policy
   - Update contributing guidelines
   - Create PR template with AI disclosure
   - Train maintainers on policy enforcement

2. **Short-term (3-6 months):**
   - Monitor policy effectiveness
   - Gather community feedback
   - Adjust guidelines based on experience
   - Develop more specific tool guidance

3. **Long-term (6+ months):**
   - Review policy based on legal/technology changes
   - Consider policy updates based on community needs
   - Potentially develop project-specific best practices

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Quality Risks:**
   - **Mitigation:** Mandatory human review, fact-checking requirements
   - **Process:** Enhanced review process for AI-assisted content

2. **Legal Risks:**
   - **Mitigation:** Clear licensing requirements, source attribution
   - **Process:** Regular policy review as legal landscape evolves

3. **Community Risks:**
   - **Mitigation:** Transparent policy development, community input
   - **Process:** Clear enforcement guidelines, appeal mechanisms

## Comparison Matrix

| Project | Approach | Disclosure Required | Quality Control | Legal Safeguards |
|---------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Python | Balanced | No | Human judgment | Basic |
| Linux Foundation | Permissive | Recommended | Variable | Strong |
| ASF | Detailed | Recommended | Human responsibility | Comprehensive |
| QEMU | Prohibited | N/A | N/A | Complete avoidance |
| Gentoo | Prohibited | N/A | N/A | Complete avoidance |
| **DISCOVER (Option A)** | **Guided** | **Required** | **Strong human oversight** | **Balanced** |

## Conclusion

The research shows a spectrum of approaches from complete prohibition to permissive allowance. For DISCOVER-Cookbook, Option A (Guided AI Assistance) strikes the right balance by:

- Allowing beneficial uses of AI tools
- Requiring transparency and human oversight
- Maintaining content quality standards
- Protecting legal interests
- Supporting the project's educational mission

This approach is adaptable and can evolve as the technology and legal landscape develop.

title: Assessment of the event

 ✅ Survey participants after the event to establish whether your diversity and inclusion measures had an effect.

See whether there is any correlation between being part of a minority group and how welcoming the conference felt to the individual participants. You can consider specifically asking about inclusion/diversity on the survey.

## Practical considerations
- Have a plan in place to analyze the data shortly after the event -- this can be time-consuming and you will need lots of helping hands to clean data
- Make sure you review the survey outcomes after the meeting with your organizing committee
- Communicate any findings to the next organizing committee if the conference/event is part of a series

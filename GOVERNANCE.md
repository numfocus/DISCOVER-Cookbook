# Processes

- Internal system changes are handled by maintainers directly, without others needing to be involved

- How new contributions are managed
    - A github pull request is made by anyone, preferred to be referencing a github issue unless very small change
    - A maintainer triages the issue.
        - content is tagged and assign to the editorial team to review
        - other tags are handled by maintainers
    - Revewers for a github pull request work with the contributor to approve the pull request
    - Once a pull request is approved, a maintainer will merge to the repository.
    - Once merged maintainers will add those involved to the contributors list via all-contributors

- How existing content is reviewed
    - types of edits
        - copy edits
        - rewrite for clarity
        - changing content
    - let anyone make issue or pull requests
    - in monthly meeting, we can review in person, but could be done ad hoc
    - At the monthly meeting will review
        1. open issues tagged as content related
        2. preassigned chapters

- How we determine which new content to add
    - Someone proposes new content either in a editorial meeting or on github discussions / issues
    - Editorial team votes on adding new content, perhaps a section or a chapter
    - Editorial team opens an issue saying that new content in an area is being developed
    - An editor writes or composes new content from contributions
      - Alternative, we see if anyone external wants to make contributions or take the lead in drafting the new content
    - We use the reviewing process above for the new content 

- When how do we determine when to have the editorial meeting
    - second friday every month at 1500UTC, 
    - if a majority can't make it then we reschedule with the organizer sending a crabfit survey and picking the most available time for folks.

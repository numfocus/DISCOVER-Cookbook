## Improving the Q&A Process

### Inclusive Question Submission
To make the Q&A sessions after talks more inclusive and accessible, it's essential to provide multiple ways for attendees to submit their questions. This will benefit not only hearing/speech impaired individuals but also members of quieter groups, such as younger participants or those who may be shy or less confident.

### Written Format Options
- **Website Form:** Create an online form on the event's website where attendees can submit their questions before or during the talk.
- **Social media Hashtag:** Designate a specific hashtag for the event or session where attendees can post their questions. This also helps in engaging a wider audience on social media.
- **Text Messaging:** Provide a phone number for attendees to text their questions during the talk.
- **Question Cards:** Distribute question cards that attendees can fill out and hand to event staff during the session.
- **Question System:** Use a system, such as Mentimeter, Slido, etc. These systems have the advantage that the audience can see the questions that others have asked, and the audience can vote on questions, so that the questions can be answered that are of most interest to the whole audience.

### Benefits
- **Accessibility:** Written formats ensure that hearing/speech impaired individuals can participate fully in the Q&A process.
- **Comfort:** Attendees who are shy or less confident will have a comfortable way to voice their questions without feeling pressured to speak in front of a large audience.
- **Organization:** Collecting questions in advance helps moderators organize and prioritize questions, ensuring a smooth and efficient Q&A session.

By implementing these methods, you can create a more inclusive environment where everyone has the opportunity to participate and engage with the speakers.

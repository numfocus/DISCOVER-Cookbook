# Catering

Making sure that your attendees have something they can eat at mealtimes is an important element of building an inclusive and welcoming conference.

- ‚úÖ Common dietary needs to plan for:
  - Gluten free
  - Dairy free
  - Vegan
  - Vegetarian
  - Pork free
  - Shellfish free
  - Soy free
  - Nut free - especially peanut (this is usually a serious allergy so take extra care)
  - Kosher
  - Halal
- üçé Ask your caterer to create and provide labels with lists of ingredients for each dish.
    - Best to have a sign/small label in front of each dish with a list of ingredients and common labels (e.g. &quot;gluten-free, vegan,  includes peanuts&quot;). 
- üçé Make sure to include a variety of beverages, in particular non-alcoholic and non-caffeinated.

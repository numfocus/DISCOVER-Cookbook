# Assessment of the event

âœ… **Survey participants after the event** to establish whether your diversity and inclusion measures had an effect.

âœ… **Use structured survey templates** to ensure you collect meaningful, comparable data.

âœ… **Analyze results systematically** to identify specific areas for improvement.

âœ… **Track progress over time** if your event is part of a series.

## Why Assessment Matters

Post-event assessment is crucial for:
- **Evidence-based improvement**: Understanding what worked and what didn't
- **Demonstrating impact**: Showing stakeholders the value of inclusion efforts  
- **Community learning**: Contributing to broader knowledge about effective practices
- **Participant feedback**: Ensuring attendee voices guide future planning

## Survey Templates and Key Questions

### Core Inclusion Climate Survey

- How likely are you to recommend this event to a colleague? (1-10)
- Did you feel you could be your authentic self at this event? (Yes/No/Somewhat)

**Specific Inclusion Dimensions:**
1. **Safety and Respect**
   - "I felt safe expressing my opinions during sessions" (Strongly Agree â†’ Strongly Disagree)
   - "I observed respectful interactions between participants" 
   - "I felt comfortable reporting concerns if needed"

2. **Accessibility**
   - "The event accommodated my accessibility needs" 
   - "Information about accessibility was clearly communicated"

### Demographic and Background Questions

**Important**: See the [Event Registration](./10_event_registration.md) section on "Demographic Info" before collecting identity information.

**Recommended demographic questions** (all optional):
- Career stage (Student, Early career, Mid-career, Senior, Other)
- Years in field (0-2, 3-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16+)
- Geographic region  
- First time attending this type of event? (Yes/No)

**Identity questions** (include only if needed for analysis, all optional):
- Gender identity (with inclusive options and "prefer not to answer")
- Race/ethnicity (with comprehensive options)
- Disability status
- LGBTQ+ identity
- First-generation college student status

### Open-ended Feedback Questions

- What made you feel most welcomed/included at this event?
- What barriers to participation did you experience?
- What specific improvements would make this event more inclusive?
- Any other comments or suggestions?

## Data Collection Best Practices

### Survey Design
- **Keep it short**: 5-10 minutes maximum completion time
- **Mobile-friendly**: Ensure accessibility on all devices
- **Anonymous**: Use unique IDs rather than names when possible
- **Incentivize**: Consider small thank-you gifts for completion

### Timing and Distribution
- **Send immediately**: Deploy survey within 24-48 hours after event ends
- **Multiple reminders**: Follow up 3-5 days and 1 week later
- **Multiple channels**: Email, social media, event platform announcements
- **Set deadline**: Close survey 2-3 weeks after event

### Response Rate Goals
- Target **30-40% response rate** minimum
- Higher response rates (50%+) provide more reliable insights
- Consider incentives if initial response rate is low

## Data Analysis Framework

### Quantitative Analysis

**1. Overall Metrics**
- Calculate mean scores for all Likert scale questions
- Identify lowest-scoring areas (biggest improvement opportunities)
- Track response rates and demographic representativeness

**2. Demographic Comparisons**
- Compare scores across demographic groups
- Look for significant differences (>1 point on 5-point scales)
- Pay special attention to underrepresented group experiences

**3. Correlation Analysis**
- Examine relationships between different inclusion dimensions
- Identify which factors most strongly predict overall satisfaction
- Look for unexpected patterns or concerning correlations

### Qualitative Analysis

**Open-ended Response Coding:**
1. **Read all responses** to get overall sense of themes
2. **Identify recurring themes** (positive and negative)
3. **Categorize feedback** by topic area (content, venue, networking, etc.)
4. **Count frequency** of different themes mentioned
5. **Extract specific quotes** for illustration and action planning

### Red Flag Indicators

**Immediate attention needed if:**
- Overall welcoming score <7/10 for any demographic group
- >10% report safety concerns
- Significant score gaps (>1.5 points) between demographic groups
- Multiple reports of harassment or discrimination
- Accessibility complaints from multiple respondents

## Benchmarking and Goal Setting

### Internal Benchmarking (Event Series)
- **Track year-over-year changes** in key metrics
- **Set specific improvement targets** (e.g., increase overall welcoming score by 0.5 points)
- **Monitor demographic representation** in both attendance and satisfaction

### External Benchmarking

**Industry Standards:**
- Overall satisfaction: Target >8.0/10
- Welcoming feeling: Target >8.5/10  
- Safety concerns: Target <5% reporting issues
- Recommendation likelihood: Target >8.5/10

**Compare with similar events:**
- Join informal networks of event organizers
- Share anonymized benchmark data when possible
- Learn from events with strong inclusion reputations

## Action Planning Framework

### Immediate Actions (Next Event)
1. **Address urgent issues** identified in feedback
2. **Fix specific problems** mentioned by multiple respondents
3. **Communicate changes** to previous attendees

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Systematic review** of lowest-scoring areas
2. **Training programs** for organizers and volunteers
3. **Policy updates** based on lessons learned
4. **Infrastructure changes** for accessibility or safety

### Success Metrics
- **Year-over-year improvement** in key scores
- **Reduced demographic gaps** in satisfaction
- **Increased diversity** in both attendance and satisfaction
- **Positive community reputation** and word-of-mouth

# **Improving Accessibility and Inclusiveness in Scientific Events: Making Visa Processes easy to encourage Global South Participation**

## **1\. Introduction**

Scientific events play a pivotal role in advancing knowledge, fostering collaboration, and driving innovation. Conferences, workshops, and symposiums provide platforms where researchers share discoveries, engage in critical discussions, and establish valuable networks. However, for scientists from the Global South, particularly from Africa, South America, and parts of Asia, attending these events often presents significant challenges due to restrictive visa policies and bureaucratic hurdles. Visa-related barriers disproportionately affect researchers from these regions, limiting their participation in international conferences. These challenges perpetuate the underrepresentation of the Global South in global scientific dialogues, creating a gap in knowledge exchange and reinforcing systemic inequities. This chapter explores the challenges posed by visa restrictions and offers actionable solutions to ensure greater inclusivity and accessibility for all scientists, regardless of their country of origin.

## **2\. Understanding the Visa Challenge**

Many scientists from the Global South encounter significant obstacles in securing visas to attend scientific events. These challenges include:

* **Lengthy and Bureaucratic Processes:** Visa applications often require extensive documentation, long wait times, and unpredictable outcomes.  
* **High Rejection Rates:** Many applicants are denied visas despite having valid invitations and funding.  
* **Financial Proof Requirements:** Embassies frequently demand excessive financial guarantees, making it difficult for early-career researchers to qualify.  
* **Geopolitical Bias and Discrimination:** Certain countries face disproportionately high rejection rates due to political considerations, rather than individual merit.  
* **Limited Access to Information:** Visa procedures and requirements vary widely, making it challenging for applicants to navigate the process effectively.

These barriers not only hinder individual researchers but also affect scientific progress by limiting diverse perspectives in academic discussions.

## **3\. Impact on Scientific Progress**

The exclusion of researchers from the Global South due to visa restrictions has far-reaching consequences:

* **Knowledge Gaps:** The absence of scientists from diverse backgrounds limits the exchange of region-specific research, reducing the global understanding of scientific issues.  
* **Reduced Collaboration Opportunities:** Scientific progress thrives on collaboration. Visa denials prevent researchers from establishing international partnerships that could lead to groundbreaking discoveries.  
* **Reinforcement of Systemic Inequalities:** Scientific communities in high-income countries continue to dominate global research discussions, further marginalizing voices from developing regions.  
* **Missed Career Advancement Opportunities:** Conferences and workshops provide essential platforms for networking, mentorship, and career progression. Visa barriers hinder affected researchers' professional development.

## **4\. Practical Solutions for Improving Visa Accessibility**

Based on previous experiences supporting visa applications from different countries, we encourage the organizer should provide support in this manner:   

1. **Early Invitation and Visa Support Letters:** Provide official invitations well in advance to allow sufficient time for visa applications, Ideally, invitations should be sent out 6 months before the event    
2. **Dedicated Visa Assistance Teams:** Establish support teams to guide attendees through the visa application process, connect people who are applying from a single country together, and support group applications if possible. This will support an exchange of information between the applicants  
3. **Advocacy and Negotiation with Embassies:** Work with diplomatic channels to facilitate smoother visa approvals for conference attendees.  
4. **Decentralized Event Locations:** Organize events in visa-friendly countries or rotate locations to ensure broader accessibility.

Also, here are some of the documents that are usually needed in the process. Kindly note that this list is not self-exhaustive, but could act as a guide for the process. Please be aware that documents needed by each embassy vary from country to country. 

**The organizers:**

1. Letter of invitation and support from the Organisers: check if it needs to be notarized in the host country, if it needs to be written in a particular language (the hosting country's official language, for example).   
2. Company Proof of Incorporation (valid entity) and Address  
3. Bank letters of recommendation and account statements   
4. Organizers (Host): Invitation letter  containing data, certified signature, plus proof of address, and an authenticated copy of the inviting person

**The applicants:**

1. Proof of (full) payment of consular fees.  
2. Self-introduction letter (max. 10 lines), and handwritten letters are preferable.  
3. Filled out and signed the manual visa application form.  
4. Valid passport ID page.  
5. Birth certificate (or the equivalent).  
6. Marriage certificate (or the equivalent) \- if the case.  
7. Proof of address (home or business address).  
8. If employed, proof of occupation and income (up to 4 documents).  
9. If self-employed, CAC and other documents (up to 4 pages).  
10. Bank statements (up to 3 pages: the first, the last, and a random page) – the complete set must be delivered along with the Passport.  
11. If the case, a document stating the purpose of the trip (company ́s letter, inviting letter, event schedule).  
12. Flight reservation (consider 60-90 days from the application date).   
13. Hotel reservation (consider 60-90 days from the application date).

## **5\. Call to Action**

To build a truly inclusive global scientific community, all stakeholders—event organizers, institutions, funders, and governments—must take action:

* Event organizers should prioritize visa accessibility as part of their planning.  
* Institutions and funders must support researchers with visa assistance and financial backing.

By implementing these measures, the scientific community can ensure that all voices, regardless of nationality, contribute to the advancement of knowledge. Only through such collective efforts can we achieve a truly inclusive and equitable scientific ecosystem.

## **Conclusion**

Addressing visa challenges is crucial for enhancing the accessibility and inclusivity of scientific events. By reforming visa policies and providing support structures, we can ensure that researchers from the Global South are not left behind in global scientific discussions. It is time for the scientific community to advocate for equitable access and make international collaboration a reality for all.

The NumFOCUS DISCOVER Cookbook (Diverse & Inclusive Spaces and Conferences: Overall Vision and Essential Resources) is produced by the [NumFOCUS Diversity &amp; Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC) Program](https://www.numfocus.org/programs/diversity-and-inclusion/), with support from the [Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/).

## Introduction

This cookbook is intended as a resource for **organizers of conferences and events** to **support and encourage diversity and inclusion** at those events. This cookbook is **not** intended to provide **general instructions** on how to run a successful conference or event. 

Read more about this cookbook [here](/01_about.md).

## How to use this cookbook

You **do not have to implement every suggestion** in the cookbook in order to &quot;qualify&quot; as having a diverse and inclusive event!

The cookbook is intended to help you, as an event organizer, to understand the **overall landscape** of best practices for diversity and inclusion.

**We encourage you to do as much as you can manage**, on the understanding that implementing a few well-supported and fully realized suggestions is preferable to implementing many suggestions that are poorly-supported or incomplete.

To facilitate ease of use, we have highlighted suggestions that are relatively **easy to implement** and which have a **strong positive impact**. These are &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; and marked with a red apple emoji: 🍎.

We also encourage you to do **at least one thing** in the &quot;High Impact, High Effort&quot; quadrant. These are marked with a green checkmark: ✅.

## Effort-Impact Matrix

This matrix categorizes tasks based on their effort and impact, helping prioritize activities effectively.  

|                 | **High Impact**                          | **Low Impact**                           |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Low Effort**  | 🍎 **High Impact, Low Effort**           | **Low Impact, Low Effort**              |
| **High Effort** | ✅ **High Impact, High Effort**          | **Low Impact, High Effort**             |

### Accessibility Description

3. **Bottom-left**: Low Impact, Low Effort, with no emoji.
4. **Bottom-right**: Low Impact, High Effort, with no emoji.

Axes:

## Building an Inclusive Organizing Committee

An inclusive conference begins with a diverse organizing committee that mirrors the community you aim to serve. Prioritizing diversity starts with intentional recruitment.

‚úÖ Conference chairs and lead organizers should proactively build a committee that reflects diverse perspectives:
- Seek balance across seniority, expertise, geography, academia/industry, gender, race/ethnicity, disability status, and academic lineage.
- Blend long-term expertise and institutional knowledge with fresh perspectives from new members.
- Avoid favoritism by using transparent, algorithmic, or term-limited selection processes for the steering committee.

Provide unconscious bias, harassment, and ethics training for committee members and key organizers:
- Offer in-person or online sessions before or during the conference.
- Prioritize candidates who complete such training (track participation).
- Publicly document committee policies on a dedicated webpage.

Ensure role assignments promote equity:
- Distribute prestigious technical roles and administrative tasks equitably, avoiding stereotypes (e.g., assigning "housekeeping" roles solely to underrepresented groups).
- Appoint a "diversity chair" or co-chairs to champion inclusivity and address bias throughout the event.
- Prepare a reserve list of potential committee members, anticipating higher decline rates from underrepresented individuals due to disproportionate service demands.

## üçé Photography Permissions 

 - Managing photography opt-outs: 
    - Badge lanyard at registration should be made available to indicate photo preferences (green = photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos) 

## üçé Pronoun Pins, Buttons, or Ribbons

  - Indicating pronouns:
    - Select a pin/button/ribbon for your lanyard to communicate your pronouns. Using a pin even if you don't feel like you need one helps create a welcoming space for attendees who do.
    - Color-coordinate the pins by pronoun for quicker recognition and processing by those who see the pins. This lowers the barrier to checking (look at the color). 
      - Be sure to choose colors that works for folks with color-blindness. With color-coded pins, needing to actually read them is a stress case rather than the norm. Because people are used to the ease of the normal case, they're more willing to take a little extra effort to read for the stress cases. (purple: he, yellow: she, green: they, blue: ask)
      - To be aware of: Make pins large enough to be easily seen. Make the pronoun itself the largest text, rather than the word &quot;Pronouns&quot;.
    - Another option for pronoun indication is ribbons.
      - Have custom ones printed for Zi/Zir and a "Fill in your own" ribbon. For fill in your own, make sure you provide fabric markers. (h/t @oxinabox)

## Welcoming New Attendees

- Ribbons for badges can be useful, e.g. &quot;First-Time Attendee.&quot; 
  - Consider what visual cues would encourage people to engage with one another and go out of their way to be friendly to someone.
- Consider running a mentoring program that matches experienced attendees with first-timers for networking and to provide a friendly resource to get to know the conference.

Here‚Äôs a **detailed and inclusive rewrite** of the **‚ÄúSocial Events‚Äù** section based on Leonie‚Äôs feedback and best practices for accessibility, diversity, and inclusion:

---

### ## Social Events

Social events are a valuable opportunity to foster connection and community. To ensure that these gatherings are inclusive and accessible to all participants, consider the following guidelines:


#### üßë‚Äçü¶Ω **Accessibility Considerations**

* **Venue Accessibility**:

  * Choose locations that are wheelchair accessible (including entrances, restrooms, and seating areas).
  * Ensure there are clear signs and wide pathways for mobility aids.
  * Avoid locations with long walks, stairs, or uneven terrain.

* **Sensory Considerations**:

  * Offer quiet spaces or low-sensory zones for attendees who may feel overwhelmed by noise or crowds.
  * Avoid strobe lighting or loud music unless clearly stated in advance.

* **Transportation & Parking**:

  * Provide information on public transportation, accessible parking, and proximity to the main venue.

---

#### **Event Timing and Format**

* **Diverse Timing Options**:

  * Not everyone can attend evening events (due to disabilities, caregiving duties, or other reasons). Offer options like breakfast meetups, lunchtime gatherings, or afternoon breaks.

* **Shorter Durations**:

  * Consider hosting shorter events or providing breaks to accommodate attendees who may fatigue easily.

* **Hybrid Options**:

  * For virtual/hybrid events, include closed captions and consider providing a live transcript or sign language interpreter.

---

#### **Food & Beverage Inclusivity**

* Provide a variety of food and drink options that meet common dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, halal, kosher).
* Clearly label all food items and avoid cross-contamination for allergies.
* Ensure non-alcoholic drinks are always available and just as prominent as alcoholic ones.
* Avoid centering events entirely around alcohol (e.g., host game nights, arts & crafts, walks, or coffee chats).

---

#### **Code of Conduct Awareness**

* Display the Code of Conduct prominently at social events (via signage or handouts).
* Make it clear who to contact if someone experiences or witnesses inappropriate behavior.
* Remind attendees that respectful behavior extends beyond official sessions.

---

#### **Welcoming & Inclusive Culture**

* Encourage first-timer friendly events (like buddy systems or ‚ÄúAsk Me Anything‚Äù tables with staff or volunteers).
* Use pronoun pins or name tags with space for attendees to write preferred names and pronouns.
* Avoid cliquish activities ‚Äî create inclusive games or conversation starters to help everyone engage.

---

#### **Feedback & Continuous Improvement**

* Invite feedback after each event to understand what worked and what could be improved.
* Ask attendees in advance if they have specific accessibility needs via an anonymous RSVP form.

# Inclusive practices during check-in

## üçé Photography Permissions 

 - Managing photography opt-outs: 
    - Badge lanyard at registration should be made available to indicate photo preferences (green = photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos) 

## üçé Pronoun Pins, Buttons, or Ribbons

  - Indicating pronouns:
    - Select a pin/button/ribbon for your lanyard to communicate your pronouns. Using a pin even if you don't feel like you need one helps create a welcoming space for attendees who do.
    - Color-coordinate the pins by pronoun for quicker recognition and processing by those who see the pins. This lowers the barrier to checking (look at the color). 
      - **Choose neutral colors** that avoid traditional gendered associations (e.g., avoid red/pink for women, blue for men). Consider using colors like: teal, orange, gray, and white for better inclusivity.
      - **Example neutral color scheme**: teal (he/him), orange (she/her), gray (they/them), white (ask/other pronouns)
      - **For colorblind accessibility**: Combine colors with additional visual elements such as:
        - Different geometric shapes (circle, square, triangle, diamond)
        - Patterns (stripes, dots, solid backgrounds)
        - Different border styles (thick, thin, dashed)
        - Text positioning (centered, left-aligned, right-aligned)
      - **Design best practices**:
        - Make pins large enough to be easily seen from a reasonable distance
        - Make the pronoun text the largest element, not the word "Pronouns"
        - Use high contrast between text and background colors
        - Consider testing your color choices with colorblind simulation tools
    - **The "Ask" option is crucial**: Include an "Ask" option for people who use pronouns not covered by the standard options (he/him, she/her, they/them) or who may change their pronouns on different occasions. This shows respect for the full spectrum of gender identity and pronoun usage.
    - **Alternative ribbon options**:
      - Have custom ribbons printed for less common pronouns like Zi/Zir, Xe/Xem, or other neo-pronouns
      - Provide "Fill in your own" ribbons with fabric markers for maximum inclusivity
      - Consider having blank ribbons available for people who prefer to write their pronouns themselves

## Welcoming New Attendees

- Ribbons for badges can be useful, e.g. &quot;First-Time Attendee.&quot; 
  - Consider what visual cues would encourage people to engage with one another and go out of their way to be friendly to someone.
- Consider running a mentoring program that matches experienced attendees with first-timers for networking and to provide a friendly resource to get to know the conference.

## Social Events

- &quot;First-Time Attendee&quot; lunch/dinner/coffee-break as a welcome and safe place for attendees to ask questions.
- Consider diversifying the time of day that social events happen.
  - Not everyone is available (physically or mentally) in the evenings, when social events are typically concentrated.
- Alcohol Considerations
  - We recommend the [AdaCamp Toolkit&#39;s summary approach to alcohol at events](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/)

# Event Registration

What to ask on your registration form (and what not to ask)

## Preparing to meet accessibility needs

- Outline any accessibility services you plan to provide on the registration form. Then:
- üçé Ask registrants if they have any additional accessibility needs, and if so, provide instructions on how to make the request.
  - &quot;Do you need any special accommodations to help make your time at the conference comfortable and productive? (e.g. accessibility considerations). Please email [contact@myconference.com](mailto:contact@myconference.com) and include the details of your request.&quot;
- Provide any deadlines for requests (it can be difficult to arrange sign-language translation at the last minute, for example).

## Supporting Attendance through Grants

- Ask about any grant or scholarship opportunities, e.g. for childcare, scholarships for underrepresented folks
  - &quot;Would you be interested in a grant to cover childcare or on-site childcare services? (yes/no) Which option would be most beneficial for you?&quot;

## Dietary Restrictions

- üçé Some people have severe allergies or dietary restrictions that can affect their ability to attend the conference.
- Use an open text box to ask about dietary restrictions. (Forcing registrants to choose from a pre-defined list might miss important allergies or restrictions.)
  - &quot;Do you have any dietary restrictions we should be aware of? (e.g. allergies)&quot;

## Photo Policy

- üçé If you will have a photographer at your event, include information for attendees explaining that they may be photographed and how to opt out.
  - (see lanyard/photography explanation under [Inclusive Practices](11_inclusive_practices_during_checkin.md))

## Code of Conduct

- üçé Show the text of the Code of Conduct and a required check-box that the registrant has read it and agrees to abide by it.

## T-Shirts

If you plan to offer t-shirts, consider offering more than one cut/fit of shirt.
- Provide shirt sizing information with the registration form where you ask for shirt size. (Provide a wide range of sizes, including plus-size.)
- Describe the cut in gender-neutral terms (e.g. &quot;fitted&quot; vs. &quot;straight-cut&quot;) with photo examples, rather than using gender-loaded terms (&quot;men&#39;s,&quot; &quot;women&#39;s,&quot; &quot;unisex&quot;).

## Demographic Info

- **Why do you need it?**
  - We recommend you do not ask for information just &quot;out of curiosity&quot; but rather that there are **planned actions you will take depending on the results** of your demographic question(s).
  - If you are asking just for the purpose of &quot;counting&quot; or ascertaining the diversity of your conference, we suggest doing this in the form of an anonymous post-survey instead, to protect participant privacy.
- If you absolutely must include demographic info in your registration form, **make it optional, not required**. Forcing people to identify themselves by demographic category is not an inclusive practice and may prompt [stereotype threat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat).
- ‚úÖ If you do collect demographic info, be thoughtful about the structure of the questions so that they are inclusive and don&#39;t contribute to alienating or &quot;othering&quot; marginalized people.
  - Not having an answer choice that matches your identity can be a very alienating experience.
- ‚úÖ Take anonymity and data security seriously. Have a plan for limiting access to this information and keeping it secure.
- Suggested format for demographic question:
  - &quot;Do you self-identify as an underrepresented minority in either the [conference] community or in your professional field?&quot;
    - &quot;Along which dimension(s) you self-identify as underrepresented? Check all that apply:&quot;
         - Gender identity
         - Ethnicity, nationality, skin color, race
         - Sexual orientation
         - Socioeconomic status
         - Religion
         - Age
         - Ability
         - Do not wish to provide
         - Other (please specify)

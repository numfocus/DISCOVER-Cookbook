## Social Events

Social events that take place during conferences—such as networking receptions, poster sessions, coffee breaks, and informal gatherings — are important opportunities to build community and connection among attendees.  
These gatherings should be intentionally designed to foster inclusion, comfort, and belonging for everyone.


## Event Timing and Format

#### 🍎 Low effort, high impact
- Offer a range of social event formats beyond traditional receptions or parties, such as coffee chats, group walks, or creative sessions.  
- Include smaller or quieter gatherings for attendees who may find large crowds overwhelming.  
- Ensure non-alcoholic options are equally available and visible at all events.  
- Schedule events at varied times of day to include those with caregiving or other responsibilities.  

#### ✅ High effort, high impact
- Provide hybrid or virtual participation options for social activities (for example, online networking sessions or virtual poster meetups).  
- Incorporate structured networking formats, such as “speed networking” or “topic tables,” to help attendees connect across experience levels or disciplines.
  

## Inclusivity in Social Settings

#### 🍎 Low effort, high impact
- Ensure that all social events apply the same accessibility standards defined for the main conference venue.  
- Provide clear directions or reminders about accessibility features already in place (for example, step-free routes or quiet spaces).  
- Communicate inclusivity expectations to volunteers and hosts to help attendees feel welcome and supported.  

#### ✅ High effort, high impact
- Collaborate with the accessibility or logistics team to audit the social event space and make any temporary accommodations needed.  
- Design social activities that are engaging for all abilities—for example, games or collaborative activities that do not rely on physical participation.  
- Collect feedback from participants after the event to continuously improve inclusivity in future social activities.  


## Cultural and Safety Considerations

#### 🍎 Low effort, high impact
- Remind attendees that all social gatherings are covered by the conference Code of Conduct.  
- Use inclusive language in all social event communications.  
- Avoid centering events entirely around alcohol or activities that might exclude participants from certain cultures or backgrounds.  

#### ✅ High effort, high impact
- Work with local community members or cultural advisors to design events that reflect and respect diverse traditions.  
- Offer themed activities (for example, cultural showcases or collaborative art spaces) that allow attendees to share their backgrounds in an inclusive setting.  
- Train event staff or volunteers to recognize and address inappropriate behavior promptly and respectfully.  


## Budget-Friendly Ideas

#### 🍎 Low effort, high impact
- Choose simple, low-cost activities that focus on interaction rather than expense (for example, shared breakfasts, walks, or discussion circles).  
- Use existing conference spaces for casual meetups instead of booking new venues.  
- Encourage attendees to suggest or host informal social ideas during registration or check-in.  

#### ✅ High effort, high impact
- Partner with local community organizations or venues that align with the conference’s inclusion goals.  
- Offer sponsored or subsidized tickets for social events to ensure equitable access.  
- Develop a volunteer “social hosts” program to help welcome first-time attendees.  


By designing social events that are inclusive, flexible, and accessible, organizers can strengthen community bonds and ensure that every participant feels welcome—both during and beyond formal conference sessions.

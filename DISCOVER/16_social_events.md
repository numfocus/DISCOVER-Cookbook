## Social Events

Social events are a valuable opportunity to foster connection and community. To ensure that these gatherings are inclusive and accessible to all participants, consider the following guidelines:

#### Accessibility Considerations

**Venue Accessibility**:
#### 🍎 Low Effort, High Impact,

  * Choose locations that are wheelchair accessible (including entrances, restrooms, and seating areas).
  * Ensure there are clear signs and wide pathways for mobility aids.
  * Avoid locations with long walks, stairs, or uneven terrain.

**Sensory Considerations**:
#### ✅ High Effort, High Impact

  * Offer quiet spaces or low-sensory zones for attendees who may feel overwhelmed by noise or crowds.
  * Avoid strobe lighting or loud music unless clearly stated in advance.

**Transportation & Parking**:
#### 🍎 Low Effort, High Impact,

  * Provide information on public transportation, accessible parking, and proximity to the main venue.


#### Event Timing and Format

**Diverse Timing Options**:
#### 🍎 Low Effort, High Impact, 
  * Not everyone can attend evening events (due to disabilities, caregiving duties, or other reasons). Offer options like breakfast meetups, lunchtime gatherings, or afternoon breaks.

**Shorter Durations**:
#### 🗓️ Low Effort, Low Impact

  * Consider hosting shorter events or providing breaks to accommodate attendees who may fatigue easily.

**Hybrid Options**:
#### ✅ High Effort, High Impact, 

  * For virtual/hybrid events, include closed captions and consider providing a live transcript or sign language interpreter.


#### Code of Conduct Awareness
#### 🍎 Low Effort, High Impact, 

* Display the Code of Conduct prominently at social events (via signage or handouts).
* Make it clear who to contact if someone experiences or witnesses inappropriate behavior.
* Remind attendees that respectful behavior extends beyond official sessions.

#### Welcoming & Inclusive Culture
#### 🍎 Low Effort, High Impact, 
* Encourage first-timer friendly events (like buddy systems or “Ask Me Anything” tables with staff or volunteers).
* Use pronoun pins or name tags with space for attendees to write preferred names and pronouns.
* Avoid cliquish activities — create inclusive games or conversation starters to help everyone engage.

#### Feedback & Continuous Improvement
#### ✅ High Effort, High Impact, 

* Invite feedback after each event to understand what worked and what could be improved.
* Ask attendees in advance if they have specific accessibility needs via an anonymous RSVP form.

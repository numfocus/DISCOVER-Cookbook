## Excel/Google Sheets Formulas

**For calculating averages:**
```
=AVERAGE(B2:B100) // Where B2:B100 contains your scale responses
```

**For response rate:**
```
=B1/A1*100 // Where A1=total invited, B1=responses received
```

**For demographic breakdowns:**
```
=AVERAGEIF(C2:C100,"Student",B2:B100) // Average satisfaction for students
```

**For identifying outliers:**
```
=IF(B2<7,"‚ö†Ô∏è Attention Needed","‚úÖ Good") // Flag low scores
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Low Response Rate (<20%):**
- Send follow-up reminders
- Check if survey is mobile-friendly
- Consider shortening survey for next time
- Add incentives if appropriate

**Large Demographic Gaps:**
- Investigate specific issues mentioned by underperforming groups
- Review event accessibility and inclusion measures
- Consider targeted outreach to affected communities
- Plan specific improvements for identified barriers

**Mostly Positive Responses but Specific Complaints:**
- Take individual complaints seriously even if rare
- Look for patterns in open-ended responses
- Address specific issues that could become larger problems
- Follow up with complainants if appropriate and they consented

**Mixed/Confusing Results:**
- Review survey questions for clarity
- Look at response patterns (did people understand questions?)
- Consider follow-up interviews with willing participants
- Segment analysis by event day/session if multi-day event

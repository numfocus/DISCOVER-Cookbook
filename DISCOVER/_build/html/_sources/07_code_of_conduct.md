# Code of Conduct (CoC)

 - üçé Articulate a Code of Conduct for your event
  - Get inspired by Codes of Conduct that have been phrased for other conferences (see also "Further Reading")
 
## Goals

**A Code of Conduct should:**
- Be easy to read (You shouldn't need a law degree to understand it.)
- Be easy to find
- Explain how to report problematic or unethical behavior	
- Explain the consequences of violating Code of Conduct provisions
- Include timelines/deadlines for enforcement action that will be taken

Additional ways to support and implement your Code of Conduct:
- Include FAQs
- Encourage positive behavior (don't just discourage negative behavior)
- Have a "quick" version and a "less quick" version (e.g. [JSConf](http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html))

## Awareness

Make sure that **everyone involved in your conference/event** is aware that the Code of Conduct applies to them: that not only includes participants, but also speakers, sponsors, committee members etc.

 - üçé Tick box at registration that confirms that the participant has read the Code of Conduct
     - A pop-up with a short version may also be a good idea.
     - Provide a link to the full ("less quick") version of the Code of Conduct, hosted on its own page.
 - üçé Include a copy of the Code of Conduct in the sponsor packet
 - üçé Mention that the Code of Conduct applies to the speakers in the speaker guidelines
 - üçé Ensure that Code of Conduct is **easily** accessible on the conference website
   - Should be in main navigation or in the footer (footer is a known pattern, near privacy policy / terms of service)
   - Implement additional web-based highlights of the CoC via loading pages, pop-ups, screen savers, etc.
 - üçé Include a short version of the Code of Conduct on the printed schedule as a reminder
 - üçé Mention the Code of Conduct in the welcome talk and at the start of every day, including who to contact if there is a problem/violation
 - üçé Place Code of Conduct reminders on tables at lunch and also signs in rooms reminding people during the day
 - üçé Create a large banner sign at key entrances on the Code of Conduct as a reminder.
 - If you send out daily event e-mails, include an item on &quot;Seeing or experiencing something that makes you uncomfortable&quot;
  - &quot;Remember that you can always speak to one of our ombudspersons about any matter of concern, no matter how small.&quot;
- Include short blurbs about the Code of Conduct during breaks (e.g. during slide breaks), on websites, etc. 
- Consider a visual &quot;workflow&quot; of Code of Conduct violation:
  - Report -&gt; Action -&gt; Resolution
- Make it clear what the consequences or resolutions of a violation are

## Reporting

- Ensure confidentiality of the person who is reporting the violation (and the alleged violator)
- Ensure that the data is stored securely with limited access
- Make sure that people are aware of reporting mechanisms:
  - Face to face with staff (Who is the dedicated ombudsperson or -persons?)
  - Dedicated email, e.g. to conduct@yourdomain.org
  - Fill out an online form, e.g. [O'Reilly Report CoC](http://www.oreilly.com/conferences/report-code-of-conduct.html)
- Consider how a report against an authority figure would be submitted ‚Äî e.g. if the ombudsperson is the subject of a CoC violation report, who is the report submitted to? (A good reason to have more than one ombudsperson.)


## Enforcement

- Be clear on how long it will take to resolve the situation or take an action on the violation
- Discuss in advance with the organizing committee what the specific process will be for recording and addressing a CoC violation
- When recording a CoC violation, ensure that the data are stored securely and that everyone&#39;s identities are protected. Access to the data should be limited.
- When possible, have a third party review the violation report (Another good way to handle the challenge of potential reports against authority figures.)
- Ensure the person who made the CoC violation report is aware of how it is being handled and when it has been resolved.

# Inclusive practices during check-in

## üçé Photography Permissions 

 - Managing photography opt-outs: 
    - Badge lanyard at registration should be made available to indicate photo preferences (green = photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos) 

## üçé Pronoun Pins, Buttons, or Ribbons

  - Indicating pronouns:
    - Select a pin/button/ribbon for your lanyard to communicate your pronouns. Using a pin even if you don't feel like you need one helps create a welcoming space for attendees who do.
    - Color-coordinate the pins by pronoun for quicker recognition and processing by those who see the pins. This lowers the barrier to checking (look at the color). 
      - Be sure to choose colors that works for folks with color-blindness. With color-coded pins, needing to actually read them is a stress case rather than the norm. Because people are used to the ease of the normal case, they're more willing to take a little extra effort to read for the stress cases. (purple: he, yellow: she, green: they, blue: ask)
      - To be aware of: Make pins large enough to be easily seen. Made the pronoun itself the largest text, rather than the word &quot;Pronouns&quot;.
    - Another option for pronoun indication is ribbons.
      - Have custom ones printed for Zi/Zir and a "Fill in your own" ribbon. For fill in your own, make sure you provide fabric markers. (h/t @oxinabox)

## Welcoming New Attendees

- Ribbons for badges can be useful, e.g. &quot;First-Time Attendee.&quot; 
  - Consider what visual cues would encourage people to engage with one another and go out of their way to be friendly to someone.
- Consider running a mentoring program that matches experienced attendees with first-timers for networking and to provide a friendly resource to get to know the conference.

## Social Events

- &quot;First-Time Attendee&quot; lunch/dinner/coffee-break as a welcome and safe place for attendees to ask questions.
- Consider diversifying the time of day that social events happen.
  - Not everyone is available (physically or mentally) in the evenings, when social events are typically concentrated.
- Alcohol Considerations
  - We recommend the [AdaCamp Toolkit&#39;s summary approach to alcohol at events](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/)

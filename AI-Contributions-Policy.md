**DISCOVER-Cookbook Policy on AI-Assisted Contributions**

### **1. Purpose**
The DISCOVER-Cookbook, as part of the DISC Committee under the oversight of the NumFOCUS Admin Board, values high-quality, community-driven content. As AI tools become more prevalent, we need clear guidelines on their appropriate use in contributions.

### **2. Applicability**
This policy applies to all contributions to the DISCOVER-Cookbook repository, including code, documentation, and translations.

### **3. What Counts as AI-Assisted Contributions?**
A submission is considered AI-assisted if an AI tool (such as ChatGPT, Copilot, or Bard) was used to generate or refine content beyond minor suggestions. Significant human oversight and refinement are required for all such contributions.

### **4. Transparency Requirement**
Contributors must **clearly state** if AI tools played a role in their submission. This should be noted in the pull request description, for example:
> "This contribution was assisted by [AI tool] and has been reviewed for accuracy and adherence to project guidelines."

Lack of disclosure may result in additional review or rejection of the contribution.

### **5. Review and Evaluation**
AI-assisted submissions will be assessed based on:
- **Clarity and Accuracy:** Content must be correct, well-structured, and easy to understand.
- **Maintainability:** Contributions should be written in a way that is practical for long-term upkeep.
- **Compliance with Licensing:** Content must be original and not infringe on any licensing agreements.
- **Editorial Consistency:** AI-assisted content should align with the style and tone of the project’s previous editions.

### **6. Handling AI-Assisted Cookbook Content**
For major content additions, such as expanding a new edition of the cookbook, AI-assisted content will be subject to **editorial review**. The DISC Committee and maintainers will ensure it aligns with the project’s vision and maintains high standards.

### **7. Actions on Non-Compliant Contributions**
If a submission does not meet the required standards:
- Maintainers may request revisions and additional human oversight.
- Low-quality AI-assisted contributions may be rejected.
- Repeat violations could lead to restricted contribution privileges.

### **8. Ongoing Policy Review**
Since AI technology is evolving, this policy will be periodically reviewed to ensure it remains relevant. Community feedback is welcome to refine and improve these guidelines.

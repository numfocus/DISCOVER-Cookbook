### 3. Roles to Join

To ensure smooth collaboration and high-quality translations, our Transifex team is organized into three key roles. Each plays a vital part in the localization workflow:

#### Translator

Translators adapt content from the source language into their target language, helping us reach global audiences.

**Responsibilities:**

- Translate and submit content  
- Join team discussions to ask questions or share insights  

Whether you're new to localization or a seasoned polyglot, this role is a great starting point for contributing meaningfully.

#### Language Coordinator

Language Coordinators oversee translation efforts for a specific language. They act as language-level team leads, guiding contributors and ensuring consistency.

**Responsibilities:**

- Invite new members to their language team  
- Approve or deny join requests  
- Assign or change contributor roles  
- Start and moderate team discussions  
- Review and proofread translations  
- Submit finalized translations  

If you're a seasoned contributor and passionate about your language, this role lets you help steward quality and collaboration.

#### Reviewer

Reviewers are the quality gatekeepers. They ensure translations are accurate, culturally appropriate, and aligned with our standards.

**Responsibilities:**

- Review and proofread translations  
- Submit approved translations  
- Participate in team discussions  

If you're confident in your translation skills and detail-oriented, this role is a great way to elevate the projectâ€™s quality.

## Code of Conduct

All contributions should conform to the [NumFOCUS Contributor Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct).

## Types of Contributions

The original body of work took place at a series of unconferences and various spurts of energy, today the DISCOVER-Cookbook is a living project with numerous contributors. Because it is code to produce a book rather than code for a software library or application, it has different needs than typical open source software systems. Because of these unique needs, we separate various types of contributions:

### Ideas, Questions, and Discussions

- For content suggestions, feature ideas, or general discussions, please use the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/numfocus/DISCOVER-Cookbook/discussions).
- Before submitting major content changes, we encourage starting a discussion to align with the projectâ€™s goals.

### Problems or Issues

- Submit issues on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/numfocus/DISCOVER-Cookbook/issues) with clear, detailed descriptions.
- Include steps to reproduce (for bugs) or context (for enhancements).
- Use appropriate labels/tags to categorize the issue.
- Check if a similar issue already exists before creating a new one.

### Content and Design

While content is the heart of the project, the quality of the content needs to remain high. Due to a high volume of generated text being submitted for review, content takes longer to review and approve. We value these contributions but understand that thorough review is necessary.

- Start with an idea in [discussions](https://github.com/numfocus/DISCOVER-Cookbook/discussions).
- Once the community approves, create an [issue](https://github.com/numfocus/DISCOVER-Cookbook/issues).
- Only then submit a PR referencing the approved issue.


### Bug Fixes

For technical issues with the book:

- **Check for existing issues** in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/numfocus/DISCOVER-Cookbook/issues).
- **Create a new issue** if none exists, with clear reproduction steps.
- **Reference the issue** in your pull request.
- **Test your changes locally** following our [build instructions](README.md) before submitting.

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting pull requests:

- Reference related issues (`Fixes #123` or `Related to #123`).
- Ensure you've built and tested the book locally.
- Your PR description clearly explains the changes.  
- You are open to feedback and respond to review comments.

## Commit Messages

Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages following this format:

**Format:**  
```

<More detailed explanation if needed>

## Ways to contribute to this repository

The original body of work took place at a series of unconferences and various spurts of energy, today the DISCOVER-cookbook is a living project with numerous contributors. Because it is code to produce a book rather than code for a software library or application, it has different needs than typical open source software systems. Because of these unique needs, we separate various types of contributions:

All contributions should conform to the [NumFOCUS Contributor Code of Conduct](https://www.numfocus.org/about/code-of-conduct/).


## Ideas, Questions, and Discussions
Please contribute ideas, questions, and discussions for content or enhancements over in the discussions tab.

## Problems or Issues 
Please add issues on the github issue tracker.

## Longer Initiatives

## Content and Design
While content is the heart of the project, the quality of the content needs to remain high. Due to a high volume of generated text being submitted for review, content takes longer to review and approve. We value these contributions but just understand that it will take time to add. Please start an idea in the discussions, then move to making an issue once there is approval for the content to be added to the book. After that issue is made we feel free to open a pull request against the repository to begin the review process.

## Bug fixes
For issues with other elements of the book, first make sure an [open an issue](https://github.com/numfocus/DISCOVER-Cookbook/issues) and tracking can occur on the issue. Then open a a pull request](https://github.com/numfocus/DISCOVER-Cookbook/pulls).

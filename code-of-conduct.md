# Code of Conduct (CoC)

[**Code of Conduct**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mtxLq0e9TPqcWtCikql6hd_Pva2hfu35yjtrB0PdiM/edit) **(Reshama&#39;s notes)**

## Awareness

- Make sure that **everyone involved in your conference/event** is aware that the CoC applies to them: that not only includes participants, but also speakers, sponsors, committee members etc.
  - 🍎 Tick box at registration that reinforces the fact that the participant has read it (a pop-up with a short version may also be a good idea - that way folks get the broad idea but do not need to read through it in detail)
  - 🍎 Include a copy in a sponsor packet
  - 🍎 You could also mention that CoC applies to the speakers in the speaker guidelines
- 🍎 Ensure that CoC is **easily** accessible on the conference website
  - Should be in main navigation or in the footer (footer is a known pattern, near privacy policy / terms of service)
- 🍎 Include a short version on the printed schedule as a reminder
- 🍎 Mention it in welcome talk and start of every day
  - Mention who to contact if there is a problem/violation
- If you send out daily event e-mails, include an item on &quot;Seeing or experiencing something that makes you uncomfortable&quot;
  - Remember that you can always speak to one of our ombudspersons about any matter of concern, no matter how small.
- Include short blurbs about CoC during breaks (e.g. during slide breaks), on websites etc. A good example includes a little Slack message shown when booting up
- Consider a visual &quot;workflow&quot; of CoC violation:
  - Report -&gt; Action -&gt; Resolution
- Make it clear what the consequences or resolutions of a violation are

## Reporting

- Make sure that people are aware of reporting mechanisms:
  - Face to face with staff (is there a dedicated person - ombuds)
  - Email to conduct@
  - Fill out an online form
- Ensure confidentiality of person who is reporting the violation (and the violator); as well as ensure that the data is stored securely with limited access

## Enforcement

- Be clear on how long it will take to resolve the situation or take an action on the violation
- If you have a process for recording a CoC violation, ensure that the data are stored securely and that everyone&#39;s identities are protected. Access to the data should be limited.
- Discuss: having a process for recording a CoC violation
- When possible, have a third party to review violation report
- Encourage positive behavior (as opposed to &quot;Don&#39;t do this…..&quot; but &quot;Do this….&quot;)
- Include list of FAQs
